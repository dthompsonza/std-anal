## Feelings
I feel that the repo name could reflect Star Trek Discovery - Analysis ... better than ... well, the actual repo name. Also, 
I disagree with the analysis part. From my discussion with @dthompsonza this is a prediction space, not an analysis space.
But hey, who am I to complain.

## Star Trek Discovery
Since we're at episode 4 already, I cannot offer predictions such as Captain Philippa Georgiou dying before the pilot is over.
I think my approach to this is going to be episodic, by character and for the whole season and series. See below:

### Episodes
I have no predictions right now, come back later.

#### Episode 5
[ ] Will air on Netflix by Monday 16th October 2017.

### Characters
Below are predictions I have for specific characters in the show.

#### Michael Burnham
[ ] Will replace Saru before the end of Season 1 as first officer.
[ ] Will not die.

#### Saru
[ ] Will not grow taller.
[ ] Will get better prosthetics around the lips of his mask. They seem so disconnected to his mouth movements, it is off-putting.

#### Paul Stamets
[ ] Will not die.

#### Sylvia Tilly
[ ] Will not die.

#### Captain Gabriel Lorca
[ ] Will not die.

### Season
I have no predictions right now, come back later.

### Series
[ ] War with Klingons will end.
